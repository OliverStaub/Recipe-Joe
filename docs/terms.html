      <h2>Tokens and In-App Purchases</h2>

      <h3>Token System</h3>
      <p>RecipeJoe uses a token system for recipe imports. Different import types have different token costs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Website imports</strong> - 1 token per recipe</li>
        <li><strong>Video imports</strong> (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) - 2 tokens per recipe</li>
        <li><strong>Image/PDF imports</strong> - 3 tokens per recipe</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Free Tokens</h3>
      <p>New accounts receive 15 free tokens to try the service. Additional tokens can be purchased through in-app purchases.</p>

      <h3>Purchasing Tokens</h3>

      <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
      <p>Token purchases are generally non-refundable. If a recipe import fails due to a technical error on our end, we will not deduct tokens from your account. For refund requests related to App Store purchases, please contact Apple directly.</p>

      <h3>Token Expiration</h3>
      <p>Purchased tokens do not expire as long as your account remains active.</p>
